Learning exercises implementing Data Structures & Algorithms for fun!

I learn new programming languages by implementing DSA. I decided to put it here
instead of throwing away. Because of that, the code may not be idiomatic or
useful, and it is far from comprehensive.

This space also serves as notes for code snippets.

## tests

Tests are grouped by each language and run by `make test-LANG`. Please see
Makefile for the exact commands.

Make sure to get all the dependancies for the test to run since this is a
polyglot project. It shouldn't require many external libraries however.

To run all tests:
```
make test
```
